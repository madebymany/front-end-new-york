    <p>#FENY is a <strong>free evening meetup</strong> hosted by <a href="http://madebymany.com" target="_blank">Made by Many</a> &amp; <a href="http://percolate.com" target="_blank">Percolate</a> that's dedicated to the ever changing world of front-end design and development.</p>

    <p>It's the American cousin of <a href="http://frontendlondon.co.uk" target="_blank">Front-end London</a>, which was born out of a need for an event that covers the rapidly changing and diverse world of front-end design and development.</p>

    <p>We aim to cover a wide variety of topics such as <strong>CSS, Sass / LESS, RWD and JavaScript</strong>, with thought-provoking talks from some exceptional designers and developers.</p>

            Web development has a plethora of tools to learn and evolving technologies to keep up with. It's easy to be overwhelmed. To combat this we should be focusing on the core skills of our field first, growing our skill set over time, adding tools and systems as we need them.
